# iscope

This is the iScope repository created by Des McCarter. There are two main folders:

1. web - the frontend section made up of javascript/angular/HTML5 scripts and files.
2. middletier - the entity API plus database code

Once cloned you will need to run your mongoDB server as:

1. cd iscope/database
2. mongod --dbpath .
